          <h3>Meet Diana</h3>
          <p>The Pacific Trails Resort was founded by Diana with one thing in mind: making memories with those you care about. She was tired of feeling glued to her phone and knew that it was time to turn off the wifi, strap on the hiking shoes and get outside. We hope to provide every guest the opportunity to immerse themselves in nature, while getting a good nights rest in one of our luxury yurts. Who ever said that camping couldn't be a little glamorous? All of us here at the Pacific Trails Resort can't wait to see you on the trail!</p>
